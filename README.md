# Hire_Predictor
**Objective**

Predict whether a candidate should be hired on the basis of his/her profile.

In this project, I am providing self crrated data for different candidates applying for jobs. So on the basis of their profile,using Machine Learning I predicted whether that profile should be selected for a job or not. The attributes for any candidate are:

Percentage
Backlog
Internships
First Round Percentage
Communication Skills rating

**Aim**

This is a task for learning and using basic Machine Learning algorithms for predictions.
Algorithms used are:
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. SVC
4. KNN
5. Naive Bayes

**Run**

Run the code in "Hire_Predictor_Project.ipynb" and this window will be the output.
