# Hire_Predictor
**Objective**

Predict whether a candidate should be hired on the basis of his/her profile.

In this project, I am providing self crrated data for different candidates applying for jobs. So on the basis of their profile,using Machine Learning I predicted whether that profile should be selected for a job or not. The attributes for any candidate are:

Percentage
Backlog
Internships
First Round Percentage
Communication Skills rating
